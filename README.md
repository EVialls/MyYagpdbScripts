Scripts for the discord bot YAGPDB

A small number of fun scripts created for discord servers I moderate. Free to use to anyone who finds these.

How to use:
- Copy the code from a file into a new custom command on YAGPDB's web interface. Comments on the code will give suggestions on how to set up other settings.
